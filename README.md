# Serverless Full-Stack Kickstart

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)

Learn how to implement a fully working, end-to-end, full-stack solution using Azure Static Web Apps, Azure Functions and Azure SQL Serverless. In this session weâ€™ll see and build together the simple (but not too simple!) To-Do list reference app, using Vue.js, CI/CD and more! 

## Azure Serverless Conference Recording

## Repo branches

This repo has several branches that shows the development at different stages

- 1.0: This branch

### V1.0 Notes

In this branch the solution will have a full working front-end, using Vue.js, sending REST request to the fully working backend REST API. The to-do list is saved in-memory using a List object. No authentication or authorization is supported.
