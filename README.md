# Serverless Full-Stack Kickstart

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)

Learn how to implement a fully working, end-to-end, full-stack solution using Azure Static Web Apps, Azure Functions and Azure SQL Serverless. In this session weâ€™ll see and build together the simple (but not too simple!) To-Do list reference app, using Vue.js, CI/CD and more! 

## Azure Serverless Conference Recording

## Repo branches

This repo has different branches that shows the development at different stages. This is the branch 2.0.

- 1.0: First version, no database support
- 2.0: [This branch] Database support added

### V2.0 Notes

In this branch the backend REST API service is modified so that the to-do list can be saved an managed using an Azure SQL database. Communication with the database is done using JSON too, as Azure SQL support [JSON natively](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/json/json-data-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver15). As an alternative, the same API using code [EF Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/) is also provided.
A initial option to (imperatively) deploy the database is also used, either using manually applied database script, or via the EF Core migrations.

- [Deploy the solution on Azure](./docs/run-and-deploy.md#deploy-the-solution-on-azure)

### V1.0 Notes

In this branch the solution will have a full working front-end, sending REST request to the fully working backend REST API. The to-do list is saved in-memory using a List object. No authentication or authorization is supported.

## Next steps

Everything is working now, but data is not secured. In v3.0 authentication and authorization will be added to the solution to make it complete.
